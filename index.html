        We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
        creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
        creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens that
        can be owned and traded on the Tokners network

        We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators.
      </h5>
      <p>
        There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok,
        Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we would be
        actively engaging before we go viral.
        <br />
        We would get them on our platform and they would see the opportunity to
        create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be
        traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of
        their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their
        digital currency across their channels while our native token holders
        benefit from the Tokners popularity.

        <h4>Tokners is coming</h4>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world
          population with some countries and entities actively fighting against
          its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
          fort. Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of
          tokens launched all aiming to fix one problem or the other with some
          quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to
          the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down
          that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their
          followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency
          of their favourite person and watch their investment as is with other
          cryptocurrency project. We are trying to do to this space what
          investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are
          gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard
          to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the
          "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real
          look.

          A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
          countries and creators would be paid beyond the peanuts that
          conventional social media platforms can offer.
