        We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
        creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
        creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens that
        can be owned and traded on the Tokners network

        Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital currency
        system that is dependent on growing and engaging with the community and
        also their star power. They own 10-15% of the total value of the tokens
        minted.

    <div class="box-title">
      <h4>We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators. </h5>
        <p>There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral. 
        <br/>   
          We would get them on our
          platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Tokners popularity.</p>
